   <h1>Hard core in my opinion</h1>
  <p class="li">For me, a hard core can calm you down if a problem <br>
         occurs without the need to involve alcohol and a <br>
        hard core will make you calm. This is in my opinion, <br>
        but I don't know what hard core is in other people's minds. Maybe <br>
         according to other people, the hard core will cause chaos, but in the hard <br>
          core, we have the same thoughts. When we do a mosh and someone else is hit by our mosh,<br>
           we will forgive each other.</p>
