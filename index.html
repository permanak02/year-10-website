   <p>Hardcore punk is a punk rock genre and subculture that was born at the end of the 1970s. Faster, louder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock, hardcore punk<br>
     has roots that can be traced to the early punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California. This genre emerged as a response to the dominance of hippie culture at the time.<br>
      Hardcore punk was also inspired by New York punk rock and proto-punk.

    New York punk's sound was louder than its San Francisco sibling, featuring anti-art expressions of anger, energy, and manly subversive humor. Hardcore punk rejected commercialism, the progress<br>
     of the music industry, as well as "anything that resembled mainstream rock." The lyrics often discuss social and political topics in a confrontational and politically charged tone.
    
    The hardcore punk movement also became part of the United States underground in the early 1980s, especially in cities such as Washington DC, New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Boston.<br>
     This music also spawned the straight edge movement and related submovements, such as hardliner and youth crew. Hardcore also played a role in the emergence of many independent record labels in the 1980s as well as the DIY ethos in the underground music scene.</p>
